### Mediocre Weather App (Using OpenWeatherAPI) that somehow got me a good grade in Mobile Dispositives at Uni.

This laughably simple looking app was made using AndroidStudio and tested on Android API25 and API29.
It features checking the weather at your location and anywhere you search for in the search bar, while allowing you
to bookmark locations for easier access on subsequent uses.

Texts are in Spanish, not that it has much text shown though.
